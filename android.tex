ANDROID APPLICATION  


FINDME 


FindMe is an application that works as a panic button: when arriving at a dangerous zone, the application should be activated -acting in the background-, and the application would start sending messages to the stored e-mail each time lapse, with the time and the GPS location in the message.

Then, you'll get the main window. It has a big red button at the middle of the screen, where you'll press to start the application. The application will go to background, where it'll start sending all the messages to your e-mail account.

There's also the Configuration screen, where you can change your email and your password, and the time lapse between each message.
The About screen shows the application information.
