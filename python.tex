DESCRIPTION

Welcome to the Labyrinth, traveler

Laberinto is a game where you have to go through the maze, with the help of sound guides. The board has 17x17 squares, where some can be blocked with wall or others free or with some prize.
In the game, you control a character that can only move with the arrow keys (up, down, left, right), and with him you'll have to find the exit.

In the game, you can also find some positions with stars on them, that will help you and guide you through the maze towards the end.

This game has sounds in it, specialized for players that can't see. Besides the main background theme playing, there are also alert sounds when the character is near a star, when the star is gotten, when the character bumps against a wall, or when the level is finished.

JUSTIFICATION

This project was directed towards blind people, emphazising the sound use in this game. Laberinto was implemented for blind people to boost their hearing ability and learning to making a right decision in each situation through sound.

USER MANUAL

At the start of the game we get the main screen with the title and spoken instructions of the steps of the game, showing the many sounds of the game.
After the instructions are given, you start the game by pressing any key. You start at Level 1, and the game ends at Level 5. You'll be hearing the many sound given at the instructions (like the bumping sounds), and the player has to use their hearing ability and decision making to get through each level.
For each level, you get your step count to the exit, and the number of stars that was gotten on the level.
Arriving at the end of the last level you'll get a spoken message telling the end of the game.
